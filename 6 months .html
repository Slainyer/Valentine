    <p>but anyway I really want to say that these 6 months has been a really special times for me, and I'm really grateful to have you by my side, Thank you Emily, I love you so much, I would love to go through every problem with you, as long as you're with me I felt like I can do everything, Thank you so much for being there for me and I am really looking forward for our next anniversary, I love you Emily, and I hope our relationship last forever.</p>
